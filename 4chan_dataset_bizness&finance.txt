Yes, why?Dutch bros...



Is it over for us? The current plans have you pay 35% taxes on unrealized gains startinig 2027. So it you have 100k in crypto, and it oes to 160k, you will need to pay 20k even if you didn't sell (so you will beforced to sell to pay taxes). This basically kills any plan involving long term investment. 



See for example: 

https://robeco.evivanlanschot.nl/nieuws/belastingplannen-2027-hoe-ziet-de-vermogensbelasting-er-straks-uit.html



Any Dutch anons here who have pro knowledge on fiscal law or financial construction like starting a 1 man company and such? Or hardcore investors with good plans? 



Let's discuss ways to save this. What are probabilities of still stopping this? Might there be legal trouble f.e. if brokers complain? Will tehy come to teir senses and realize killing log term gains basically hurts everyone in the long run? Any good dieas for ways to deal with this as oood as possible?>>57562497

It is over. Sorry for your loss.Je bent waarschijnlijk te arm en te dom om het land te verlaten. Dit is wat je moet doen en waar je nu mee moet beginnen. Leg al je bezittingen vast bij de belastingdienst, het is belangrijk om een historie op te bouwen. Wanneer je 900.000 aan geregistreerde activa hebt, is het gemakkelijker om winsten te verbergen en uit te geven dan wanneer je 90.000 of slechts 9.000 hebt. Als je je in crypto bevindt, zal het vrij eenvoudig zijn om je bezittingen zelf in bewaring te nemen. Hier zet je je winst in en gebruik je deze eerst voor de kosten van levensonderhoud. Dien deze niet in of zorg er voor dat je ze vóór 31 december uitgeeft. Ik ben trouwens trans, ik weet niet zeker of dat er toe doet.>>57562671

And some Dutch actually defend unrealized gains tax? At 35%???



It's like Europeans are living on a different earth. When I see that 58% of equities worldwide are American owned I no longer see a bubble thanks to how much governments elsewhere discourage investing.>>57562497

Unironically move to Tbilisi, Georgia. We could always use more white expats here. Taxes on small business (under $300k/year) is 1%, IT companies 5%, and cryptocurrency is considered non-Georgian sourced income, so 0% tax, and no need to even report it.



You can even sell crypto for cash (USD or EUR) at any street corner exchange office with not unreasonably high fees.



The raves at places like Bassiani and just random factory concerts are also better than anything offered in Europe at the moment. Oh, and since you're dutch, weed is 100% legal to buy and possess up to 100g and is smoked everywhere in public with no issue from LEO.>>57562497

>35% taxes on unrealized gains



This shit is so disgusting, "Boston Tea Party" worthy levels of disgust in the Government. Just insane inept Government overreach to the point where it's actually punitive and encourage regular people to seek either unlawful or violent solutions. 



I'd say I feel bad for Yuros but it's either just as bad over here, or about to be just as bad. We really cannot elect the fucking corpse and his crew of corrupt evil villains into office again for another 4 years or you better believe we'll see "unrealized gains" taxes on Crypto in the USA.>>57563429

I think something is going to happen at the Super Bowl tomorrow.

I think they are going to do a false flag.

A nuke, EMP, release the X virus they have been creating, or do something to everyone that took the covid vaccine.

Taylor Swift has been built up and mentioned constantly all last year.

Taylor Swift will be hurt or killed in the attack.

If she dies, it would be the passing of Swift.

A literal death of a Swift, and a symbolic death for the old banking messaging system, also named Swift.

Plus, they can use the attack to justify starting World War 3.

They'll say that Iran, China, Palestinians, Russia, White Supremacists, and whoever else they want did it.

I have zero knowledge or involvement.

My predictions are based solely off off the symbolic interpretations that other anons have noticed in the linked thread.

I do not in anyway advocate nor condone violence, nor any illegal acts.Xpayments launches this year. 

It's supposed to be crytpo/blockchain based. 

Given the paypal mafia, and how much XLM and XRP they own, surely there is a good chance it relies on these to work. 

Thoughts? And what's your prediction if this turns out to be the case? I think 10x, because Musk still won't mention either of them explicitly>>57570196

What place offers a secure 5% with low risk? Even banks are a risk. For instance the government only backs up to 250k. The rest is gone in case of a bankrun. I don't even trust that 250k amount either>>57570301

cool match, i would never play online though>>57561071

I saw in the last thread an anon was being dog piled for suggesting the basket stock theory is correct. The basket theory still holds water after all this time. To my knowledge, nothing has disproved it. Now that time has passed, Cohen's now confirmed involvement in BBBY strengthens that argument.



>the ONE stock with idiosyncratic risk



Let's think of the game theory behind this statement. If I was the SEC, GameStop has had to much public attention to ignore. Saying there is one risk, is a way to avoid people hunting for another situation like GameStop. Let me give an example. Hypothetically, you have two bodies in your house. The cops are at the door about to break in. You can either hide both bodies in the same spot or hide them in different spots. Now the cops bust in and catch you literally red handed with one body. Are you going to tell the cops that you have another body hidden somewhere in the house? Fuck no, you are going to lie and say you have only one body(one idiosyncratic risk). I find it hard to believe that only one stock has been over shorted. Considering how greedy wall street is, I wouldn't be surprised if every single stock in the market is fucked up to some degree or another.



Choosing what stocks are in the basket stock is up for debate. However, just because the SEC has said "there is one stock with idiosyncratic risk" does not make it 100% fact. Labeling a stock as a "distraction stock" is a classic divide and conquer technique. I see no issue with people holding positions in basket stock companies. Only a giga autist or shill would suggest holding a single stock. With that being said, I am pure book DRS'd and I will continue you add to my position until moass.



Finally, does anyone have actual proof that Icahn has a fucking short position in GME? I have not seen a single shred of evidence to support this claim. So until there is proof, Icahn does not have a short position in GME.>>57561191>>57560846

Their whole purpose is to syphon funds from anywhere they can into the pockets of the wealthy. They will do whatever they can, no matter how underhanded it is, to make money. They will kill companies and put people out of jobs to make money. This is not acceptable. So to go out of your way to defend the actions of hedge funds to anonymous strangers is not normal.

I am now 5x away from 6 figures in Feb 2024.

I wish I was less emotional.Welcome to the Monero General, dedicated to the discussion of the world's leading decentralized P2P privacy cryptocurrency!



Monero is secure, low-fee, and fungible, meaning users can send XMR around the globe despite corrupt governments or broken financial systems. Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero's blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.



Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.



If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.

>START MINING IN P2POOL



P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. 



P2Pool has no central server that can be shut down/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero. There's no pool admin that can control what your hashrate is used for or decide who can mine on the pool and who can't. It's permissionless!



Decentralized pool mining (P2Pool) is pretty much the ultimate way to secure a PoW coin against 51% attacks. Once P2Pool reaches & maintains 51%+ of the total network hashrate, Monero will be essentially invulnerable to such attacks.



Although many inexperienced miners think that bigger pools give better profits, this is absolutely NOT the case. Your profits in the long run depend ONLY on your hashrate, NOT on the pool's hashrate.





>YOU CAN NOW MINE IN P2POOL FASTER & EASIER THAN EVER BEFORE WITH THE GUPAX GUI. USES TRUSTED REMOTE NODES BY DEFAULT!!!!



1. Download the *bundled* version of Gupax for your OS here: https://gupax.io/downloads/

>START RUNNING AN I2P NODE





>What is I2P?



I2P is an anonymized P2P overlay network akin to the Tor network but with several key advantages over it. I2P is now replacing Tor as the go-to darknet and will play a pivotal role in growing the Monerocentric economy.





>Why should I care? Why should I run a node?



Increasing shadow economy adoption and the proliferation of an XMR-only standard are what guarantee that XMR will have a floor and won't also crash to zero when the Crypto Casino finally implodes. XMR's long-term outlook is therefore *strongly* correlated with the darknet, you may have already noticed how the number of TXs begins to drop whenever the glowies attack & cripple the Tor network, which underscores just how critical it is that the darknet wins this war against the State. Make no mistake: if the darknet is allowed to die XMR will take a devastating hit as well.



So by running an I2P node you are helping to make the network Monero thrives in that much more robust while also enraging glowies in the process. Win-win!





>OK, but how difficult is it? Do I have to store GBs worth of data like when running an XMR node?



It is literally as easy as installing an Android app and no, there are no storage requirements, the node only consumes some bandwidth.





>Cool, I'm sold. What do?



If you have no interest in browsing the darknet yourself then the simplest solution is to install & run the I2Pd Android app on any compatible (Android 4.1+) device, ideally a TV box since they don't require recharging and are permanently online. But any old phone or tablet is fine too. Make sure you activate "start on boot" in the settings.

Wash trading has been artificially driving BTC's insane price action since the first major spike in 2013.



>Wash Trading 101

1. create/maintain the illusion of high volume

2. wait for poor unsuspecting fools to FOMO in

3. dump at a fat profit and leave them holding the bag



When the supply of gullible fools finally runs out, the entire scheme implodes.



TL;DR: exciting price action means nothing in an unregulated market rife with such manipulation, real-world utilization is the ONLY reliable metric of actual value.





>No tail emission = Bitcoin is fucked 



Right now, at the current hashrate, miners break even on energy expenses at a BTC price of $22K. Post 2024 halving, that break even point, at the current hashrate, goes up to $44K. If BTC does not go to $44K, miners will be unprofitable and hashrate will have to drop (miners going out of business) to reduce the cost of securing the network, also reducing the security.



If you know anything about the power of 2, you already know that things get very big, very fast. If we’re 3 halvings into 32 total halvings, then the estimated break even point for miners at current hashrate going into the last halving would be:



$22,000 * (2^27) = $2,952,790,016,000 per BTC



$2,952,790,016,000 per BTC * 21 Million total BTC = $62,008,590,336,000,000,000 BTC Market Cap



The block rewards shrink so fast that after enough halvings BTC would eventually require a $2.95 trillion price per BTC and a $62 quintillion market cap to sustain the current cost of $7.15 billion/year.



Even if these numbers were somehow realistic, can you imagine securing a $62 quintillion market cap on only $7.15 billion/year of hashrate? LOL



So basically BTC mining will eventually become so unprofitable the hashrate (network security) will shrivel up UNLESS it is subsidized by BTC transaction fees.

>Does CEXs in talk even mean anything?

Yup. You literally just have to wait. If you've ever delt with any retail, getting a product out is a pain. 3-5 business days per-EMAIL in 2024(current year).



Redtape & funds is all you have to work through for smaller CEXs. You can completely ignore volume & holders.



Big CEXs are a different beast but take just as long, requires higher hold rate & volume. Smaller CEXs offer that stepping stone. 



During all the peaks and dips, this is all being actively worked on. The reason linu holders say "Buy, hold, wait, win", because you just have to wait.

This thread coming up now exactly in my week of panic attacks about this matter.



Check the subreddit “aperiophobia”, it’s about this. Freaking out trying to comprehend a concept that it’s outside of our world: eternity. 

Living inside a box, escape from it, to then find yourself in another bigger box. Again, again, again. Error 404.



That sub is really helpful, but in the end the only way out of it is to let go and try to feel it this way: you are a bunch of electrical signals in your brain, once dead you are not going anywhere. You just chase to exist. It is what it is, so don’t try to deal with this, you will fuck up your brain trust me. Just accept that no matter how much you think about it or the way you think about it will change the situation. It is this way and it’s out of your control. You were nothing before and you’ll be nothing after, the best thing you can do is enjoy life at its best and fulfill the perception of you five senses while here. Life is a lottery win, better enjoy it while you can and not worry about stuff that’s not under your control and not even part of life itself.



Also remember, we are not coming from anywhere, we were part of this world before, so we are now. We are animals and as we get older you’ll fell like the need of death. Just ask old people, there’s a biological desire to death because we are programmed to die. Our brand evolved a lot and something touch stuff that is outside of our comprehension. 



Keep in mind that everything you know and feel is from this world and reality, so all the things that make you feel good. Enjoy them as much as you can. Nothing matters! be free!



I leave you with another question instead, and there’s no logical explanation to that trust me. Why you got consciousness in the body you are rn, and not for example and another body 1 billion years ago? While you became conscious only now? Fells like we were put here by someone else, doesn’t it? A simulation maybe?>>57562692

There is no meaning

You can cope all you want around this but life is void of meaning. It's terrifying but even more terrifying is being in denial about this. You can sit idle and wait to die or you can join the rat race and climb the ladder or you can be a coomer or degenerate or whatever. It doesn't fucking matter and your life is short spark across eternal nothingness.



You can cope all you want about this but you know I'm right>>57562803

>you have so live it

>you have to live it

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1LsIQr_4iSYOh boy it's another Le Deep /pol/ Thread where people who were just shilling jeetuckinu are talking about life and death. Chud STOP lmao there are people like stefan molyneux that went to college for 8 years to teach philosophy. Lower your toneits not comprehensible to us but awareness/consciousness/raw experience (whats left if you strip away "you") is one eternal thing. "god" is a good name for it i suppose



in that sense evolution is literally god waking up and yet here you are still an insufferable faggot posting dumbass jew shit. good luck!>>57564421

i would argue diminishing the brain diminishes our ability to process language/reality. it does not dimmish "raw" or base consciousness. i.e. the thing that is one thing. the all seeing eye is 

 a metaphor for this concept.



youre either conscious or not. consciousness, as im referring to it, does not mean you thinking youre you, or liking bacon or something like that. i agree that is a function of organs e.g. the brain



theres an excerpt from hellen keller. she was deaf and blind before she learned language. when she learned through touch it was a profound revelation on the nature of reality, awareness, and language



there is a reason we have no clue what it really is. even defining it eludes our grasp>>57562692

>Die

>Take off the VR headset and your "friends" all laugh and mock for getting the lowest possible score at this game of "Life"

>want to die even more nowDoes anyone of y’all ever like get the feeling of being put here in life. Like being in a simulation were you’re temporarily here to then go back to somewhere else? I can’t grasp the fact of not knowing where i came from, or remembering the moment i became conscious. Like why in this body and not in one of the many billions who were born? Why in this moment of time and not 1 thousand years ago? Feels like i’m hacking my brain.>>57562692

That's the human experience. This is why people cling to religion, science, recreation. Everyones freaking out but that's just everyday Anon. 

try to learn about history. So much has been done, will be done and for dumb little lies that keep us humans alive>>57564689

whats left is god. regardless, whatever it is, it exists outside of the reality we know



i believe there is nothing inherent except experience. the observer and subject are two sides of the same coin and that all there is. if a tree falls in the woods and no conscious is there then its not relevant if the tree falls. no one knows what there is. it cannot be proven without an observer. do you think the sunset is beautiful if no one sees it? where is the beauty - there is none inherently. even at a subatomic level the universe appears to do things different pending an observer. why isnt AI self-aware? what is the missing component? its god. these are all facets of the one thing im talking about



i see what your saying and agree but i think there more to it than what you experience as real. its void and empty if you look close enough



good convo. cheers>>57563092

>If they do, they must have started somewhere?

That's a mentally-disordered jewish way of thinking. The non-jewish way, in particular the Native European worldview, is that things have always existed. The universe is infinite and never "came into" existence (naturally, since the universe; that which is, is existence itself; existence itself can't arrive from itself into itself); it has always been and always will be. 



The jewish worldview requires the universe to have a beginning, hence why this idea: >>57567054 & >>57567075 came about how it did; why it was invented by people with non-European mindsets.>>57562692

existence/nonexistence

does not exist.



memory is an illusion



the now is always changing



the self is multipleI hope there is an afterlife, I hope that I will get to experience every different mode of being for eternity. 

I believe in God and i believe he is omnipotent and omnibenevolent, therefore I trust that the world we are living in Is the best possible world out of all the different possible combinations, I suspect existence would get stale if you lived in an uninterrupted chain of consciousness in the same surroundings, even God would bore of this set up. That is why it creates cycles of existence, if God is infinite, then his creation must have an infinite amount of possible variations, our individual lives are like a single thread in a giant tapestry. 

Fractals are a cool concept to think aboutEverywhere in nature, you can see God's handiwork

Intelligent design should be blatantly obvious to anyone who takes the time to notice it. 

There are many human opinions about God, we should be cautious with these human opinions, and focus on what God itself says, and it's language seems to be mathematics, geometry and symbolism>YOU WILL GET REINCARNATED IN THIS ERA

Technical analysis (chart tea leaf reading) trading goes like so:

select your candle period (only one. say 1 day candles)

going through like fifty different chart indicators and prune them with backtesting

eventually settle on a set of maybe three to five that all work fine in tandem. Meaning you usually get a trend going if all of them agree to buy or sell at a particular time. 

You will know the rough accuracy rate of your bullshit widgets based on your backtesting

Buy when the bullshit says buy, sell when you decided you to sell as a profit take and sell again when your gizmos say sell or short

Keep doing this



Basically you are making an algorithm based around a few chart indicators. You can inject your intuition in to this but in my experience it's a bad idea. Not taking signals because you FEEL they are wrong is at best a 50/50 coin flip and will perform no better and possibly worse than just blindly following what your asshattery says to doWE CAN DANCE IF WE WANT TO

WE CAN LEAVE YOUR FRIENDS BEHIND

'CAUSE YOUR FRIENDS DON'T DANCE AND IF THEY DON'T DANCE

WELL THEY'RE NO FRIENDS OF MINE



SAY, WE CAN GO WHERE WE WANT TO

A PLACE WHERE THEY WILL NEVER FIND

AND WE CAN ACT LIKE WE COME FROM OUT OF THIS WORLD

LEAVE THE REAL ONE FAR BEHIND



AND WE CAN DANCE

AND SING



WE CAN GO WHERE WE WANT TO

THE NIGHT IS YOUNG AND SO AM I

AND WE CAN DRESS REAL NEAT FROM OUR HATS TO OUR FEET

On a side note:

>The 2007–2008 Credit Crisis



>The 2007–2008 credit crisis is most likely the only severe example of a credit crisis that has occurred within the memory of most Americans.



>The 2007–2008 credit crisis was a meltdown for the history books. The triggering event was a nationwide bubble in the housing market. Home prices had been rising rapidly for years. Speculators jumped in to buy and flip houses. Renters were anxious to buy before they got priced out. Some believed prices would never stop rising. Then, in 2006, prices hit their peak and started to decline.



We are seeing a collapse in China due to sharply declining house prices within a credit crisis and resulting stock market collapse. Despite artificially inflated no-sale Zister listings, U.S. housing prices are coming down too. The 2008 GFC was felt all over the world and started in just one country multi-national interest was invested in. It was banking and stocks. This time, it's Chinese paper/bonds that can't be redeemed and companies globally are taking billions of losses. This too, will quickly be felt all over the world.



When China's bond market knocks over the U.S. banking system, there will be limited options. Crypto will become a safe-haven and volatility will be seen as reprise for early institutions eating prior losses. PMs will see a boost, central banks have already been hoarding gold for the last 2-3 years.>Almost took you seriously until you started shilling crypto phewWe're going back up boysssssssssssssssthis really says a lot. wow..alright. so which one is it?

After several months of degenerate cold approaching women. Going to several women clubs around campus. Trying to chat up girls every single day, even in class. Meeting women at sorority parties. Talking to grad students and professors during office hours. I have officially talked to every girl on campus. The feeling of knowing every single woman on campus is something none of you could ever experience in 1000 lifetimes.



You may know me as that one weird kid who just went up to you one day and tried to start a conversation and failed miserably. Not a single girl passes me who I do not know the name of. That one's Kate. That one's Ana. That one has two names I forget which. But it does not matter.



I have built a rock-solid foundation of communication skills from asking how the weather is to what's your favorite type of ice cream. Every girl that enters my field of vision trembles in fear. They have only level 68 communication skills WHILE I have LEVEL 69!!



After all this work, I still have yet to go on a date. But that won't stop me. Every girl on this campus had better watch out because I'm fucking leveling up. They won't be able to give me a bullshit excuse like "im busy" anymore. I've ascended to an attractive gigachad. Here I come, women.>>57548308

>The Company believes that the Proposal contains false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s DirectStock Plan, which serve as the basis for the Proposal. The Proponent alleges that the availability of recurring purchases under the DirectStock Plan allows for market manipulation and suggests that the Company and Computershare are facilitating fraudulent behavior. The Proponent also alleges that “BofA Securities,” “internet users (with positions of power and influence)” and potentially others utilize the DirectStock Plan’s recurring purchase feature to manipulate the market. Whether these assertions are factually accurate is unclear at best, as they appear to be mere speculative assertions made by the Proponent regarding potential wrongdoing of third parties. Further, including speculative assertions of market manipulation without supporting evidence will leave shareholders misguided regarding the purposes of the shareholder vote.



>Moreover, it is unclear how the recurring purchases authorized under the DirectStock Plan are related to the transactions about which the Proponent expresses concerns. Finally, neither the Company, nor Computershare, allow recurring purchases to facilitate any fraudulent or illegal conduct. The disclosure of recurring purchases is used to facilitate market transparency.



>The false and misleading statements described above relate to the Proposal’s fundamental purpose – that the Company disallow recurring purchases under its DirectStock Plan – due to various speculative assertions, thus rendering these false and misleading statements material to shareholders in deciding how to vote on the Proposal’s merits.

https://youtu.be/p20AShtOnQc?si=gP1jRCqGVgEHQeWLNews about longwall mining in the United States, with a census of longwall systems and faces



https://www.coalage.com/features/longwall-operators-add-capacity-for-2024/>>57543176

Hah, I would gladly go work in a mine or as a roughneck on a rig, onshore or offshore! Alas, I don't live in the Land of the Free (or of the Leaf). Aside from moving abroad for employment, my avenues here are 1) a trade, 2) self-employment which is easier said than done, 3) higher education which takes a long time if I even manage to pass the entrance exams.



I'm 26. Hardly broke, actually much better off than most of my peers who often sadly can't control their spending very well. Working fulltime at a warehouse but I've been here for like seven years now and I feel like I could apply myself better somehow if I really put my mind to it. I actually tried searching for offshore rig jobs in Norway but they really don't take anybody without relevant experience. The pay is decent and whenever there is overtime available I try to book myself there, that's where the yuros really come from. Currently doing a double shift but wasn't able to sleep the night prior for some reason so I'm looking forward to getting home to bed.>>57541596

I love LIO but damn, I'm happy I sold the top at 1.44



I'll still rebuy it if they pay off their debt though, I really like their land package.>>57544142

Because they are all gay pump n dumps (all of them) and the mining sector is the most heavily manipulated part of the metals market so even the good ones tend to eat shit. He will occasionally go into a mining ETF if it becomes -heavily- stretched below the mean, but overall the stance is that Miners are a crappy business. Ask anyone here who works in the mining business.



You have to be autistically good at DD to make money in miners. There are like two or three people in this thread that I've seen make consistent gains by speculating on metals juniors who aren't just gambling or shotgunning. French Anon is one of them and he's glued to CEO interviews and has paid subs to newsletters that specialize in mining DD. Power to him. It's not for me though, I stick to memelines where I can't get diluted to fuck overnight by one of the "winners".

And very occasionally buy fracking sand.>>57544610>>57544641

>fracking sand

This guy fucks>>57545438Steel continuing downward, HRC was 944. Scrap at 475. I think it will continue downward, but I'll watch scraps movement for a reversal. 



Steel stocks have been doing pretty good, but, I think we're seeing some rotation out of tech and maybe some people are rebalancing energy and infrastructure into their portfolio. I guess I'll see what happens when steel bottoms. I wish there was a steel ETF (spot steel, not steel stocks), because I might get stuck having to figure out futures trading.>>57546671

That's funny I bought XOM today also, for basically the same reason. Oil is just so fucking cheap right now. I realize it's supply driven, but at a certain point it has to just go nuts imo. I mean I'm paying the same at the pump as I did over a decade ago, basically. This will not last. 



I expected HRC to go down. We're like 70% recycled steel in America, lots of it is produced in mini mills, scrap is going down, so steel should also. When scrap goes down, so does steel, roughly. I'd love to get some other anons excited about this relationship because it's so ridiculously correlated there has to be something we can do with this. Check out this correlation analysis I did, it took data from now until back to 2016. If you're not familiar with correlation analysis, basically 1 is perfectly correlated, -1 is inversely correlated, and 0 is not correlated. So scrap is .87 with steel! Lately, steel stocks have been on quite the run despite steel going down. When scrap starts going back up enough, I'll likely buy steel stocks and hope that they go up, but it's not perfect. I think there needs to be a bit of technical analysis (which I don't know) mixed with quantitative investing (which I'm doing in a very rudimentary form). But there is something here and I really think we can make some money at this.>>57546671

>>57547432

Chart of HRC versus scrap. I mean the next step is really figuring out how this interacts with the stocks and we could have a little quantitative investing ring going here at /cmmg/. 



Anyways, I'm on it every night as much as possible (and at slow days at work) trying to figure it out.Wasn't this a /cmmg pick?>>57546671

>>57547432

XOM is goat; been holding mine since early '22. Wanted to add at $93, but it only dipped to $96. These are decent prices, but my bargain rule of thumb is buy when forward divvy > 10y UST yield. In terms of the supply situation, the US economy may be limping along, but other developed zones aren't doing so well, which will weigh on demand. Also Africa & Middle East have lots of dollar debt which they finance by selling oil.



>>57547432

Interesting notes I see:

>X largely uncorrelated, possibly due to buyout prospects fixing the price on M&A risk premia vs market fundamentals.

>Natural gas largely uncorrelated except for oil, for which ng is a byproduct of extraction.

>Scrap has a slightly higher correlation than steel for companies listed



>>57548434

Back when /cmmg/ started, we thought pm's were on the precipice of breakout. I think a lot of the oldies didn't really anticipate the dollar strength over 2022, and silver is still having a rough time. That said, now is a pretty good time to bargain hunt in the silver space. I think many expected to join a sprint and didn't realize it was a marathon.



>>57547432

I think I'm alright at TA, but it's more a probabilistic art at price point potentials. Price is a function of prevailing narratives and shifting expectations. You start with a fundamental thesis and use TA to make reasonable price predictions based on that narrative. In many ways it leans into /x/ skills, like astrology where you look at a birth chart for certain elements of the story that's going on. I've stopped using moving averages since they're backwards looking and already "baked" into the candles. If there's a specific ticker you want TA read, throw it out here for any anon or I to take a look at. TA is something that just takes practice: looking at charts every day, drawing lines, placing fib overlays, making projections/predictions, and seeing how accurate you were. But it means little without knowing the fundamentals & macro.>>57548691

The thing about scrap is that it leads steel, versus if I graph scrap + CLF, for example, it correlates greatly but scrap doesn't seem to lead enough to give me clues as to when to buy. So I'm stuck at the "I see scrap moves before steel, but how do I translate that into what stock to buy?" 



I think the answer may partially be learning some TA in combination with knowing these correlations. I don't know where to start though, are there any good tutorials?>Kazatomprom supply issues

Even Keith from first Majestic knows Mexico is shit and has been diversifying out of Mexico and buying properties outside of that country.



The only hope is if they elect a person like nayib buklele but as far as I know there is no ultra based libertarian running for president. If someone was and going to win, there would be a mad rush to invest in Mexican mining.>>57550671

Thanks for such a thoughtful response. I'll keep at my FA and try to find the least snake oil TA channel to start learning a bit of that to help with entry and exit points. 



I see what you mean about quant work, but I think having some basic understanding of how things are moving has helped me understand the market more. I'll keep at the FA and of course report back to everyone!>>57551512

>the least snake oil TA channel

There are others of course but those are my go-tos.>>57551541

Those seem pretty snake oil lol, but thanks. I'll check them out deeper.>>57551854

>Those seem pretty snake oil lol

That's just the nature of the game. If you're looking for a channel that doesn't shill itself or its services you'll be looking forever.



I've made money off both of their calls and helped other anons ITT make money based on what I've learned from them having used their paid services.



You don't need to pay them to learn from them of course, but they are legit in their tools. They have solid TA and are worth learning from if you want to expand your own TA.Am I too late to get in the Uranium train?I want to thank the oil bros for this beautiful February day.>>57558424

Damn, anon. You really are proving yourself to be retarded more and more with each post, but I'll bite.

I meet with them at the fucking restaurant or place we're going to, or the nearest park and such, first.

If they don't agree to such simple things, they are simply worthless.

If all goes well, we go to a hotel.

If they can't agree to such simple thing, again, worthless and a waste of time. Don't care, move on to other things.

It's not that complicated, anon. Any woman who'd just go to your fucking house to meet you there without actually knowing you first, like in the example you gave, is fucking retarded and looking to get trafficked.>>57565917

We did have it a lot better than zoomers have it though. It sure didn't feel like at it that time but women are so fucked now. 



Last year on the 4th of July I went to the river and all the girls there were literally wearing thong bikinis with their entire ass exposed. Back in my day, you would barely find 1 girl out of 50 who was a big enough slut to do that.Were all slaves.I've been looking at the chart lately, and I couldn't help but notice we are on the brink of something very important. Newer technologies have always played an important role in how we map out our future...ICP is one of those technologies. Tell me the last time you used your phone. Mmm, let me guess...prolly 5 minutes ago? Of course unless, you're on it right now!. Truth is, the way ICP is harnessing the power of storage capability will enhance our daily lives and will make our funds SAFU. Over all, there's yuge promise on this crypto. Sheesh, I remember I almost bought it when it was 200$...good thing I waited until today to pack my bags. We are going to the moon. Everyone feeling bullish? We're about to start a new technological era. Fasten your seatbelts, guys.>>57567086

Yes you would need to host an OS inside the WASM code which is executed on the ICP container. You would then run your Python script on that.

Im not forecasting. Just the possibilities i see.

It doesn’t need to go back down to 35k and touch the megaphone boundary even if it corrects at 52k. It might though.



ATH is a big resistance this time. It failed to break it twice. 40% or more corrections are very normal in bull trends too and we’ve get to have one. I was not expecting on yet, but from now on i think its time to be ready for one. If the megaphone breaks to ath over next months i do think ath will be a strong candidate for a strong correctionYou can feel his panic. He just sold 2.5btc, bought eth with it, and provided more ETH collateral instead.



This guy is acting really irrationally now, changing his collateral around every couple hours, essentially changing what he is shorting link against ever so slightly.He’s consolidated the position back to mostly short against Eth and btc again, instead of USD.

I feel too busy lately to even message back my dad. The stress is bleeding into everything and I'm feeling like I'm on the verge of a mental breakdown.



I truly hate everything, but also feel like a huge pussy for being unable to cope with a fucking WFH software job. It's just eating away at my soul.



I don't even look forward to weekends because all I think about is work. I just want to quit but the job market is so shit I'm worried I'll eat up half my savings before I find anything else.



My girlfriend has health issues and effectively have a dead bedroom. Nothing in my life lately except frustration and disappointment. I wage and provide but at the end of the day don't even have any material aspirations. Only thing I'd like is a house and maybe a fun car so I can go on roadtrips. Day to day there's nothing even rewarding to spend my money on.



What the fuck is the pointI feel for you anon I left a job that I loved to try something new because we also bought a home.

I hated it so much a couple of weeks in and I was mentally in a dark place. I'm luckily going back into the same job and already feel so much weight off my shoulders.

I have a massive amount in ICP and truly believe that our house will be paid off in a couple of years.

You can do this anon the bull run is just around the corner buy ICP or whatever else you want but make it a big clip. 10k -15 usd minimum and you will get a house easy. Sell between April 2025-Oct 2025 don't fall for the this time it's different meme.>>57568008

Anyone hanging onto hope for this is being delusional. If you try and wait for the mc to get back where it was when you bought, you’ll just be riding the chart down to 60k.

Do silberbugs really?Post your old sterling charms :)this scammer is so brazen. zero fucks given.Met up with some Chinese business associates yesterday to celebrate Chinese New Year. I gave them a Buffalo gold coin to grease the wheels knowing chinese love of gold gnome wuttum saying? Anyways I was asking them if they like silver they looked at me like I was retard and started listing all the reasons it was stupid so I joined in knowing they think westerners are dumb telling them about the reddditors who brag about paying 40% premiums cuz muh collapse premiums are smart and dont matter they will buy houses for a silver $ etc, they couldn't really believe people were that stupid. Most of the conversation was in English my Mandarin being limited but they were translating some to a great granny.....when she heard about the 40% premiums she started jabbering BAIZUO BAIZOU over and over and cackling like a maniac.....definitely made her day as much as the ounce of gold.

Got damn, you ever seen an uglier piece than this?Hey frens,

The past 2 days have been amazing slurp-wise. I didn't win nearly as many auctions as i hoped for, but i think i secured the best deals i was eyeing, so that's great.

First is the "joke" i tried to make in previous bread with this lot of silver junk coins i paid 35 bux over spot, pretending to be retarded. But i had an emergency irl and couldn't post the "merely pretending part", so here we go. 

334€ total, sold as random junk, but coming with a surprise!>>57566430

Thanks Anon for keeping up the great work! 2022 and 2023 were record setting year for us with premiums at near all time highs. We know there's some of you who have been let down by prices not hitting the stratosphere yet. Dont let your loss of purchasing power dissuade you from building more savings. With spot prices falling faster than inflation, nows the greatest time buy the dip and dollar cost average. The trend-line of the last ten years is down so dont miss out on the next decade!>>57567117

Pretty happy only paying 2 bux over spot for this one kek.>>57567160

The spot price looks so tempting....

Only if the premiums weren't so damn high.Then i got a brass XVIth c. countermarked monetary weight for the 8 reales coin. Seller couldn't identify it because the flip side is really worn down, but since i already bought few of those i immediately knew what it was.

Paid 12 bux for it, 26.5g. Pretty damn cheap!Then, a lot of x6 antoninianus from various period, the pic is incredibly shitty, so for this one it's a gamble more than a slurp. But for 6.50€ total, this is a gamble i take every day of the week.>>57567160

>>57567176

Just god fucking DAMMIT look at this shit. Look at this shit and tell me it's not tempting.>>57567212

bis repetitaThen a bunch of randoms coins. If you don't look too closely, it seems that only the silver swiss coins and the big mexican billon (low silver alloy for the newbs) pesos might be worth it. But the last coin to the bottom is a 5 reichspfennig military coin from 1940. Quite rare because they were only minted for the army in few examplars, and on top of it most have been melted down after Germany lost.

I got this lot for 28€, and the pfennig alone with pay for the entire lot plus some extra. I didn't try to identify everything in this lot, and couldn't anyway, but maybe more good surprises are awaiting!Then a crappy out-of-focus greek bronze unit (at least i think so). Probably will turn out looking like shit irl, but i paid 4.50€ for it so once again no regroots with this kind of low risk gambles.And finally the best for last, a giga-rare papal states' silver testone of Clement X from 1675. 8.8gr.

Deep down i know i made a killing with this one, but i don't know how much of a killing. The coin is so rare i could only track down two sales taking places for it in high-end auction houses over the past 2 decades. And the final price is behind paywalls for guests, as always with this kind of places.

So basically very low liquidity, but potentially big bux if i find the right buyer. And since i got it from a pro seller the pedigree of the coin wont be too hard to track down. Actually i found this very coin as photo model for the coin ref on an italian numismatic website.

Condition isn't top notch but still with nice details.

I secured it for only 79€ (my max bid was settled much higher than that so it was a pleasant surprise).>>57567322

The other side.>>57566448

I showed my son this picture and he loves them. Where are they from?Ah there is also a set of stamped flatware from nazi Germany that i got yesterday to complete my collection. Wont post them all, and they weren't really slurpy-tier since i got it only slightly below market price, but i'm always happy to find those.So overall very happy with my purchases, on top of the deals i got earlier this week, i can say it was well spent few hours scouting on ebay.>>57567372

They are the best to own, by very far all my favorite coins are my greek ones.

Speaking of, look at what showed up earlier today in the mail. A Pergamon's cistophoric tetradrachm. 12.5g of pure silver fondling pleasure!

Sorry for the low quality, i just took the pic in the dark.>>57567216

I received a phone call last November that my LCS had one (I mentioned I would be interested in buying one if they ever got ahold of any months prior). Spot was high nine hundred at the time - which was well within my initial range to scoop of 850-950. I decided to pass on it though. I just didn't like the chart and all the negative news pushing it down. I am still going to scoop one day, but I will wait for a bottom to establish itself. They aren't as liquid as you would think, and I find them hard to find. When you do the premiums are high enough to pull IQ off the beach and into the thread. Your deal is quite good considering the current spot price.>>57567395

Wdym? I'm openly a nazi enjoyer to everyone in my life. My frens greet me with roman salutes to say hello, my living room now looks like a 3rd Reich museum, and Xmas family reunions always end up with me explaining to my nephews (never young enough to warn family about the jewish menace) and cousins how the holohoax is a complete scam.

If i was giving a single fuck about what people think of me or if i was a career whore i guess that could be an issue, but thank god i don't give a shit.>>57567623

one of the only reasons bitcoin had success was that it was given out for free in the beginning to those who released it like diamonds over time. I mention diamonds specifically as well because of their abundant nature, as crypto is rehypothecated, it is almost infinitely abundant to exchange administrators, who legally (sec15c3-3) can borrow from cold wallets up to 140% of the value as collateral for debt. In london, there is no limit to rehyopthecation for brokers (exchanges are legally brokers)

Assets that are digital and abundant are pumped by printed currency while Precious metals are on the other end of the manipulation, as they are shorted, to give the notion that the dollar is mighty; for it can give a return over time which can purchase metals for cheap.

FtfySlinky Doge introduces a groundbreaking model to redefine fair token launches, offering a free airdrop and commencing trading with only 100 tokens and a market cap of a mere $60. This innovative token employs a unique rebase mechanism that aims to positively adjust user wallet balances by 1% to 10% daily, as long as Slinky's price remains above $1 until it discovers its intrinsic fair market cap. Notably, Slinky prioritizes holder security by mitigating the risks typically associated with negative rebases through a new method: an algorithmic increase in the burn rate, which aligns with Slinky's price. During this 'negative rebase period', the new method would only affect sellers. Additionally, the token safeguards buyers by disabling burn-on-transaction, ensuring users face no slippage when purchasing, regardless of the current burn rate.

as authoritarian censorship increases, the next trend will be SocialFi or decentralized social medias.

plebbit could potentially x100 as plebbit is a decentralized p2p social media protocol that is opensource, free to use and scalable.

it has no https endpoints and a working demo.

as it has no https endpoints and instead used ENS for sub or board/usernames, it is more decentralized than federated alternatives which are more complicated.

the plebbit token will only be for tipping and voting on a DAO on development issues.

>40% of LP fees of 0.99% trading volume (as of this point, but changes could happen) will be used to buyback and burn tokens in order to create an ever-decreasing supply.



>Farming

For the initial 3 months after protocol launch there will be farming for users trading on the protocol. The rewards will be 5% of the entire token supply, equally split between 90 1-day periods.

0.055% of GOAT supply (8.88 billion) will be rewarded to traders each day



>Staking

until the day the protocol launches, each user will gain staking points just by holding tokens in their wallet.

During the first 3 months after launch of the protocol the revenue that would be used to buyback GOAT tokens will instead go toward rewarding stakers. .

after 3 months , there will be an airdrop of your owed portion of the revenue given in ETH



>Distribution

was initially done through a fair launch. 90% of the token supply was deposited into the pool and available for trading. The remaining 10% went to team tokens.

team has withdrawn some liquidity for funding and now has ~18% of funds split between everyone on the team for all work and investment. The remaining 82% is owned by the community and the liquidity pool.

5% of the supply will be used for initial trading farming.



The full marketing campaing hasn't even started .The full GOAT protocol is launching between 1 and 3 months

it's an easy 10x minimum from here and a promising project for the bull run

>8. Ryan Cohen writes the letter to BBBY's board after buying a large stake in the company.

>9. Ryan Cohen sells his stake to an unknown party, not on the market.

>10. BBBY is shorted to oblivion and is theorized to be many times over the outstanding share count short, the company even walks shorts into a trap by providing dilution rumors in the form of warrants and class A convertible shares (all which never hit the market).

>11. BBBY undergoes chapter 11 proceedings, in doing so it is revealed the value of the company in NOLs (several billion in tax breaks for a potential startup).

>12. IP is sold to Overstock, a company who has battled naked shorts before in the legal world.

>13. Legal language similar to m&a activity begins to appear in the Ch 11 bankruptcy dockets.

>14. Teddy, Ryan Cohen's company, is a financial instrument with trademarks for baby goods as well as bed and bath retail goods.

>15. GameStop releases a quarterly document with 10x the normal instances of m&a disclosures/information.

A merger or acquisition for a stock to stock deal forces all the shares to be accounted for, tallied, and distributed to their respective parties. This type of deal can be used to counter naked shorting, as it forces all shares to be located and assigned to their respective owners, not held in street name. Shares being held in street name is why there can be more shares sold short than the entire share count outstanding, if all shares are held in shareholders' names directly, this would not be possible.



Going to pop along with GME.



Also ken griffin has a former presidential secret servicemen as a bodyguard. He is being protected because he is throwing hedgefunds and market makers (dougshit) under the bus and needs to be alive in order to do so.

Go awayI can't believe you retards just stayed in crypto markets after 2021 and just kept hodling and shitting your money away.



You are not an intelligent group of people, that is the truth. Despite the high opinions 4channers have of themselves they are incredibly unintelligent people.



And I'm not talking in any sense about whether crypto is a good speculative investment right now or at any point moving forward. Instead I'm just observing the intense stupidity of you tards to stay in these markets and literally just ride that obvious spiked bubble all the way down for more than 2 fucking whole years.



It's indicative of how stupid all of your other more general views, attitudes and cultures are on this site too even outside of finance.



Pic somewhat unrelated except that it's a good example of how funny you tards always are when you're whining about "THE NATIONAL DEBT!" a la Fox News and InfoWars and you've got no concept of how dumb you sound for not knowing the debt needs to be viewed on a logarithmic scale. You're idiots and you're brainwashed.Cause it’s a based coin>>57569691

there are still opportunities. 

as authoritarian censorship increases, the next trend will be SocialFi or decentralized social medias.

plebbit could potentially x100 as plebbit is a decentralized p2p social media protocol that is opensource, free to use and scalable.

it has no https endpoints and a working demo.

as it has no https endpoints and instead used ENS for sub or board/usernames, it is more decentralized than federated alternatives which are more complicated.

the plebbit token will only be for tipping and voting on a DAO on development issues.

It seems they're trying to navigate around market and regulatory challenges with a decentralized approach.

checked and basedCan Warren Buffett be using technical analysis but he is trolling all of the people?I saw this getting promoted by Matt Wallace so I asked myself “why is Matt Wallace Promoting a Memecoin?”



So I dig in deeper and found out this is more than a Memecoin and have serious money behind it. 



cia dot com Domain is priced at 5 million usd. Emails are selling for $200. It’s basically a blue chip utility combined with meme. They want floor to be held by long term holders. That’s why you see only 850 holders but ATH 50M



If they manage to sell 1 million emails this year than the revenue will be $200 million usd that will go towards benefiting the holders.

Why there aren't games in which you could do that with real money? Suppose you make a chess.com page in which you could bet money, it would be flooded with stockfish bots and cheaters. Nobody would be playing real chess there. Also, there must be strict local and international laws concerning gambling and videogames.ccip isn't general access yet>weekend pump

Im honestly tired of waiting for AGRS to reach $300 already. It reached that $447 peak and then went down to $200 and started crabbing.

At the same time, I also do not want to miss on the last gigapump blowoff top. It all happens so fast. It may be the only ticket to join 7 figure limbo. I really want to have that feel that I have 7 figures, it's just like maxing out on your character starts, it would feel like an upgrade, the mental confidence would be there.

If you want to earn some extra cash we can meet up. I have needs.Anyone else noticing how traditional gaming seems to be shifting towards Web3 lately? It's interesting to see how they're trying to tackle market and regulatory hurdles by embracing the decentralized nature of Web3. Looks like they're aiming for more innovation and a less cutthroat environment. Also, stumbled upon this project called Aethir, apparently they're building some decentralized cloud infrastructure for gaming and AI. Could be worth keeping an eye on, given the direction the industry seems to be heading.How much should man provide(finance) before being called a simp(who give too much) or a beta(who give too little)?

FUCKING NIGGER FUCKWe are in a tight spot, and I need some advice regarding our family home. I am near Toronto.



The house is my dad's it's currently worth ~860k, he currently has ~100k left on the mortgage, and the rate is 2%. 



My dad has several health issues, and is due to retire in 3-4 years, but I think he'll be forced to retire sooner. Also in 2 years we are due for a mortgage renewal which will bump our rate to 6%.

Our family lives tight as it is, and I don't think we'd be able to afford that.



We always lived paycheck-to-paycheck but good lives, my dad makes around 50k, I make ~110k and give him 1k a month for rent (have only started earning in the last year out of college). He doesn't have any retirement or savings/investment.



What should we be doing? I have a total of ~80k between stocks and crypto, but can't outright pay the mortgage in full to the banks, they only allow a max of 10k a year surplus.



Should we sell this house, and get something in the range of ~600, and I'll put the rest into dividends/stocks for my parents to use in retirement. It is a big house, and all my siblings left. Just me (and my girl when we get married) live in this house, and we will stick with them going forward.

Atheists are Christians mentally, and Christians are Atheists mentally. There's no real difference. You worship Albert Einstein as your savior instead of Rabbi Yeshua, for instance. Instead of the Bible stories you believe in """science""" like dark matter and black holes and whatever, and Big Bang is just another version of the jewish creation story.>>57567035

The big bang idea was invented by the Christian theologist Robert Grosseteste (1168-1253), first head of the university of Oxford. He had a vision that his Hebrew god Yahweh created a tiny spot of light that exploded rapidly taking the matter – which was simultaneously created by the god – with it to form a spherical universe.



And the cosmology based on the "big bang" idea, in the modern sense, was conjured up by the Christian Catholic priest Abbe Georges Lemaître.



The pioneering Nobel Prize winning plasma physicist and electrical engineer Hannes Alfvén said about Lemaître:



> "I was there when Abbe Georges Lemaître first proposed this theory. Lemaître was, at the time, both a member of the Catholic hierarchy and a scientist. He said in private that this theory was a way to reconcile science with St. Thomas Aquinas' theological dictum of creatio-ex-nihilo (creation out of nothing)."



> "There is no rational reason to doubt that the universe has existed indefinitely, for an infinite time. It is only mysticism saying the universe was created - whether four thousand or twenty billion years ago.



> "Since religion intrinsically rejects empirical methods, there should never be any attempt to reconcile scientific theories with religion. We must not confuse religion and science. An infinitely old universe, always evolving, isn't compatible with the Book of Genesis."



Lemaître is famous for his description of the beginning of the universe as "A Day without Yesterday" in reference to the Creation account in Genesis.



The Jew George Gamow, another famous Big Bang proponent, had no compunction in describing the graphs of conditions in the Big Bang as "Divine Creation Curves" and sent a copy of his book "The Creation of the Universe" to the then Pope.

In January 1933, the Christian priest Abbe Georges Lemaître travelled with the Jew Albert Einstein to California for a series of seminars. After the priest Lemaître detailed his Big Bang theory, the Jew Einstein stood up, applauded, and said:

> "This is the most beautiful and satisfactory explanation of Creation to which I have ever listened." 



Due to this, the Big Bang idea is theology and merely another creation story. It's theology and mysticism, not science.



Lemaître allowed his theological convictions to predetermine the outcome of a scientific inquiry. This violates the scientific method.



Furthermore, the ex-nihilo created universe in the Big Bang model is a universe that's entirely filled by a continuous indivisible distribution of mass with a monotonically decreasing macroscopic density and pressure or a finite averaged macroscopic density and zero pressure in terms of the energy-momentum tensor for a perfect fluid. Therefore it violates the Principle of Equivalence and Special Relativity as required by Einstein himself for his gravitational field model. So not only is it Creationism, it's also schizo.>>57567035>>57567081>>57567091>>57567123>>57567138>>57566967
